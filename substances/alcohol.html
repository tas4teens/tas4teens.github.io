            <p class = 'bodyText'>Alcohol is all around us. It can be seen on sale at stores, sold at bars and restaurants, or perhaps in your household cabinet. You may even know someone who drinks alcohol on a daily basis. Close to 140 million people in the United States above the age of 12 have used alcohol in the past month. <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/report/2019-nsduh-annual-national-report" class = 'citations'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Because of the widespread availablility of alcohol, most of us have probably seen someone drunk.

            <section id = 'aud' class = 'subtitle'>What is Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)?</section>

            <p class = 'bodyText'>AUD is a brain disorder where one drinks alcohol uncontrollably, despite causing harm to his or her own body. It can be split into mild, moderate, and severe categories. People with AUD often struggle to control their alcohol intake, leading to severe consequences, such as loss of a job and strained family relationships. Excessive alcohol usage and <b>binge drinking</b> (when a male takes 5 or more drinks within 2 hours, or when a female takes 4 or more drinks within 2 hours) have been shown to increase the risk of AUD. <a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/understanding-alcohol-use-disorder" class = 'citations'><sup>[2]</sup></a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20369243" class = 'citations'><sup>[3]</sup></a> </p>

Although he is underage, he wants alcohol so much that he uses a fake ID. After getting his hands on alcohol, he would stay away from home for hours on end, leaving his parents worried. His grades start slipping because he won't do his homework. Worst of all, when he is home on the weekends, he gets short-tempered and violent because he doesn't have access to alcohol at home.</p>
                <p class = 'showMoreTextCaption'>As seen above, John is so desperate for alcohol to the point he risks prosecution by using a fake ID. His use of alcohol has severe consequences for not only himself but for those around him.</p>

            <p class = 'bodyText'>Around 414,000 adolescents struggle with AUD. Although this is only 1.2% of the entire adolescent population, studies have shown that <b>those who start drinking before the age of 15 are 5 times more likely to develop AUD compared to those who start drinking after 21.</b> Genetics may influence an individual's likelihood of developing AUD, along with the environment.<a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/understanding-alcohol-use-disorder" class = 'citations'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

            <p class = 'bodyText'><b>Effects on the brain.</b> Once alcohol is ingested, it acts both as a depressant (slowing down activity) as well as a stimulant. Alcohol decreases the levels of glutamate, a neurotransmitter which is responsible for increasing brain activity, while increasing the levels of GABA, another neurotransmitter that is responsible for calming everything down. Because of these fluctuating levels of neurotransmitters, alcohol <b>slows your brain down and affects the speed at which the brain could process information. <sup><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2012/10/16/what-alcohol-really-does-to-your-brain/?sh=b964755664ea" class = 'citations'>[4]</a></sup></b> Alcohol also damages the ends of neurons, which relay nerve impulses to the brain. (For example, if someone tried to throw a ball at you at full speed, you would try to dodge to avoid the impact. <sup><a href="https://www.webmd.com/connect-to-care/addiction-treatment-recovery/alcohol/serious-effects-alcohol-on-brain" class = 'citations'>[9]</a></sup> The reason you're able to dodge is because neurons are "telling" your brain that a ball is coming at full speed towards you, and the brain works to move your hands and legs to dodge the impact.) If the ends of neurons are broken, a "connection" to the brain can't be formed well. As a result, a lot of physical symptoms happen, such as slurred speech, impaired coordination, slower reflexes, and blurred vision.<sup><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/why-does-alcohol-make-you-drunk" class = 'citations'>[5]</a></sup></p>

            <p class = 'bodyText'><b>Effect on the liver and related parts.</b> The liver can only break down so much alcohol per hour, and its rate can't be increased. <sup><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/why-does-alcohol-make-you-drunk" class = 'citations'>[5]</a><a href="https://www.colgate.edu/about/campus-services-and-resources/parent-alcohol-handbook/how-alcohol-works-body" class = 'citations'>[6]</a></sup> Because of this limitation, when you ingest a lot of alcohol in a short amount of time (also known as <i>binge drinking</i>), alcohol tends to accumulate in the bloodstream, leading to increased diameter of blood vessels. This can cause many problems, such as a rapid decrease in body temperature and low blood pressure. <sup><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/why-does-alcohol-make-you-drunk" class = 'citations'>[5]</a></sup> More severe consequences of alcohol buildup in blood are cardiac arrest, arrythmia (irregular heartbeat), passing out, and seizures.<sup><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/alcoholism/overdose" class = 'citations'>[7]</a><a href="https://americanaddictioncenters.org/alcoholism-treatment/body-effects" class = 'citations'>[8]</a></sup> The liver is also subject to stress every time it tries to break down excess alcohol, which can lead to permanent liver damage such as cirrhosis (an <i>irreversable</i> liver scarring that affects its function).<sup><a href="https://americanaddictioncenters.org/alcoholism-treatment/body-effects" class = 'citations'>[8]</a><a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohols-effects-body" class = 'citations'>[10]</a></sup> Alcohol also stops the secretion of antiduretic hormone (ADH), which tells the kidneys to hold in water. As a result, excessive urination may happen, leading to risk of dehydration.<sup><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/why-does-alcohol-make-you-drunk" class = 'citations'>[5]</a></sup></p><br>

            <p class = 'bodyText'><b>Effects on other parts of the body.</b> Alcohol is also absorbed thru the small intestine, and this alcohol passing through through small intestine can damage the tissue in the digestive tract. Because many other nutrients are absorbed through the tissue of the small intestine, this can lead to malnutrition due to inability to absorb nutrients. Other complications also include hemorrhoids (internal bleeding) and ulcers (literally a hole in your digestive tract). <sup><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/alcohol/effects-on-body" class = 'citations'>[12]</a></sup> <b>Alcohol has also been shown to increase the risk of getting cancer </b>(more specifically, mouth, larynx, esophagus, colon, and liver cancer). When alcohol is consumed, it breaks down into a chemical called acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde damages the DNA in your cells and causes the cells to grow uncontrollably. (Remember, in order for cells to divide, proper DNA replication is necessary. If the DNA is damaged, the process is affected.) This uncontrollable cell division is what cancer is. <sup><a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohols-effects-body" class = 'citations'>[10]</a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/alcohol/index.htm" class = 'citations'>[11]</a></sup></p>

            <p class = 'bodyText'><b>Tying it all together.</b> As you can see, there are a lot of side effects that alcohol can have on your body, and some of them are a product of excessive or long-term usage. Unfortunately, this is where the danger of AUD (a type of SUD) come in. When one is struggling with AUD, he or she has a very hard time stopping drinking. Because of this, one will consume large amounts of alcohol over time. <b>Because the most severe effects are from long-term usage that can be caused by AUD, it is important to not fall into the cycle of AUD.</b></p>
